   <P> Iteration 8</P>

 <p>1) Creating a file called view.php<br>  
 	This is the contract for all the pages. Have a file management system set up.<br> 
	This takes the URL parameters and invokes them.<br>
 	To create the page, use _GET["< urlVarName>"]<br>
	to get the variable in the URL.
	Using the as a function file. The aim is to get the view working<br> 
	Try to get the query to pull certain items when looping through teams and employees.</p>
<p>2) Extend the support of searching AT, ART and ST.<br> 
	You may want to break it out to another file where all the queries reside.<br>
	That way it should increase readability*<br>
	Support partial or full string match.<br>
	SupplyOne type of item = one table<br>
	Multiple types = multiple tables.<br>
	Use if else statements to figure out the tables to display.</p>
<p>3) Hyperlink should show the VIEW of that respective item.<br>
	The names of the view and search should be switched to match and have<br>
	those working as they should so they're linked properly.<br> 
	For the use of an external hyperlink,<br>
	This would be a primitive PHP example: <br>
	echo '< a href="http://www.website.com/page.html">Click here</ a>'.<br>  
	For a PHP internal link, 
	please use: < a href="<?php echo get_page_link( get_page_by_title( PAGE_NAME )->ID ); ?>">Link Title</a></p>
<p>4) If the view forms have any items, those should also have the HYPERLINKS. <br>
	Adding hyperlinks will make things easier and faster.
	One can hop from one item to another item by clicking on the hyper links.  <br>
	Please see the code used on the search.php page for how to use the hyperlinks.<br>
</p>
<p>5) For having a setup where a help.php can read a file like help.html <br>
	Methods like fopen, fget, and fgetss can be a blessing.<br>
	The fopen methods are probably the most familiar to old-time C<br>
	and C++ programmers because they're more or less the tools you've had <br>
	under your belt for years if you've worked with these languages. <br><br>  
	For any of these methods,
	you go through the standard process of using fopen to open the file,<br>
	a function to read the data, then fclose to close the file.<br>
	<p>
	The fopen function creates the connection to the file. It<br>
	creates the connection because in addition to opening a file
	fopen can open a URL.</p>
	<p>
	 The "r" used in fopen indicates that the file is open for reading only.<br> 
	However, you should change "r" to "rb" if you're reading from binary files for cross-platform compatibility.</p>
	The feof command detects whether you have already read to the end of the file and returns True or False.dd<br>
	Skipping ahead to the end of Listing 1, fclose serves the opposite function<br>
	of fopen: It closes the connection to the file or URL.<br>
	You are no longer able to read from the file or socket after this function.<br>
	<p>
	'r'<br> 
	Open for reading only; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file.
		<br>'r+'<br>
	Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file.<br> 
'w'<br>
	Open for writing only; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file and truncate the file to zero length.<br> 
	If the file does not exist, attempt to create it.<br> 
'w+'<br>
Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file and truncate the file to zero length.
If the file does not exist, attempt to create it.<br> 
'a'<br> 
Open for writing only; place the file pointer at the end of the file.<br> 
If the file does not exist, attempt to create it. In this mode,<br>  
fseek() has no effect, writes are always appended.<br> 
'a+'<br> 
Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at the end of the file.<br> 
If the file does not exist, attempt to create it. In this mode, fseek()<br>  
only affects the reading position, writes are always appended.<br> 
'x'<br> 
Create and open for writing only; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file.<br>  
If the file already exists, the fopen() call will fail by returning FALSE and generating an error of level E_WARNING.<br>  
If the file does not exist, attempt to create it. This is equivalent to specifying<br>  
O_EXCL|O_CREAT flags for the underlying open(2) system call. <br> 
'x+'<br> 
Create and open for reading and writing; otherwise it has the same behavior as 'x'. <br> 
'c'<br> 
Open the file for writing only. If the file does not exist, it is created. If it exists,<br>  
it is neither truncated (as opposed to 'w'), nor the call to this function fails (as is the case with 'x').<br>  
The file pointer is positioned on the beginning of the file. This may be useful if it's desired<br>  
to get an advisory lock (see flock()) before attempting to modify the file, as using 'w' could truncate<br>  
the file before the lock was obtained (if truncation is desired, ftruncate() can be used after the lock is requested).<br> 
'c+'<br> 
Open the file for reading and writing; otherwise it has the same behavior as 'c'.<br> 
'e'<br> 
Set close-on-exec flag on the opened file descriptor. Only available in PHP compiled on POSIX.1-2008 conform systems.
