   <P> Iteration 8</P>

 <p>1) Creating a file called view.php<br>  
 	(this is the contract for all the pages). Have a file management system set up.<br> 
	This takes the URL parameters.<br>
 	To create the page, use _GET["< urlVarName>"]<br>
	 to get the variable in the URL.</P>
<p>2) Extend the support of searching AT, ART and ST.<br> 
	You may want to break it out to another file where all the queries reside.<br>
	That way it should increase readability*<br>
	Support partial or full string match.<br>
	One type of item = one table<br>
	Multiple types = multiple tables.<br>
	Use if else statements to figure out the tables to display</p>
<p>3) Hyperlink should show the VIEW of that respective item.<br>
	The names of the view and search should be switched to match and have<br>
	those working as they should so they're linked properly.<br> 
	For the use of an external hyperlink,<br>
	This would be a primitive example: <br>
	echo '< a href="http://www.website.com/page.html">Click here</ a>'.<br>  
	For an internal link, 
	please use: < a href="<?php echo get_page_link( get_page_by_title( PAGE_NAME )->ID ); ?>">Link Title</a></p>
<p>4) If the view forms have any items, those should also have the HYPERLINKS. <br>
	One can hop from one item to another item by clicking on the hyper links.  <br>
	Please see the code used on the search.php page for how to use the hyperlinks<br>
</p>
<p>5) For having a setup where a help.php can read a file like help.html <br>
	Methods like fopen, fget, and fgetss can be a blessing.<br>
	The fopen methods are probably the most familiar to old-time C<br>
	and C++ programmers because they're more or less the tools you've had <br>
	under your belt for years if you've worked with these languages. For any of these methods,<br>
	you go through the standard process of using fopen to open the file,<br>
	a function to read the data, then fclose to close the file<br>
	<p>
	The fopen function creates the connection to the file. It<br>
	creates the connection because in addition to opening a file
	fopen can open a URL.</p>
	<p>
	 The "r" used in fopen indicates that the file is open for reading only.<br> 
	However, you should change "r" to "rb" if you're reading from binary files for cross-platform compatibility.</p>
	The feof command detects whether you have already read to the end of the file and returns True or False.dd<br>
	Skipping ahead to the end of Listing 1, fclose serves the opposite function<br>
	of fopen: It closes the connection to the file or URL. You are no longer able to read from the file or socket after this function.<br>
